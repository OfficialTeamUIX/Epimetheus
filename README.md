## About The Project
This project was built out of necesity. Simply put it is an STM addon board for Xbox "HDMI" addons that can be built rather than using a developer/debug board to match your current hardware install while retaining the dev/debug functions. As-is, it is non functional until paired with an ST-Link dongle, and an existing pineapple flavored product, and license.

The original debug/devboard utilization this board was based on.
